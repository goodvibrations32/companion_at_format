# Scripts 
This repository is for generating my Desktop environment with the bear minimum tools.
## Shortcuts
The xmonad, dmenu, colorscripts and other blinks used in my desktop are "stolen" from *Distrotube's* configs that are truly waaaay more detailed i could ever make them. So as a shortcut in the scripts I download the **dtos-core-repo** and letting his terminal installer to do the work. 
Here is the link to his configs in gitlab:
